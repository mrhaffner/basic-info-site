This is for the Basic Informational Site assignment from The Odin Project.

This is the first back end project and it uses NodeJS.  The purpose is of this assignment is to gain basic familiarity with Node to create a simple project directory.

Added a new branch: express. This branch has the same project done using ExpressJS.
